        <h5>Created by The End Tags - Emmanuel Mendieta and Stella Ngo <br></h5>
            <h6>We were both pretty buys with work over the weekend, so we didn't get to spend enough time on this Hackathon.<br><br>
                Overall, we learned a lot of stuff and will probably do better on the next one. <br><br>
                Once again (<i>and I can't stress this enough</i>), we didn't get to spend too much time on this, so what you are about to see probably will not fare well against the rest.</h6>
