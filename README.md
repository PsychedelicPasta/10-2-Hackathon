# 10-2-Hackathon
HCSS KPI Dashboard. Team: The End Tags

Start with cover.html (I know it's not intuitive)

Team Members: Stella Ngo and Emmanuel Mendieta

We didn't get to spend a whole lot of time on this, we were both busy with work and stuff this weeekend. 
If it wasn't obvious, this is our first hackathon. 


We built it with HTML/CSS/JS. We were trying to go with React.JS, but it was taking a while to get comfortable with it. 

We're probably going to keep working on this and finish it in the days/weeks to come.
